# Frequently asked questions

In this part, we attempt to answer questions frequently adressed to stan.contact@oecd.org

## OECD.Stat

STAN ISIC Rev. 4
:   Data can be accessed at http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=STANI4. A file with all numbers in long format is available from the "Export", "Related Files" section. Monetary values are in national currency units. For conversion to USD, please use exchange rates from http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SNA_TABLE4.

## Classification

Do "transportation and storage activities" include in-house logistics?
:   The 4-digit structure of ISIC Rev. 4 is available at [UNSD](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=118). It does not mention in-house logistics. You may want to adress your request directly to the publishing National Statistical Office. For an overview, please see the STAN Country Notes section.

Is 2-digit information available for EU countries?
:   Eurostat is collecting information in NACE Rev. 2 (ISIC Rev. 4) from member countries based on 64 industries. The detailed content of each of these aggregation levels can be found in the annex of the before mentioned Commission Regulation (EU) No 715/2010. More information on NACE Rev. 2 is available in the Eurostat Statistical classification of economic activities. For example, the ISIC Rev. 4 industries 58-63 are partly aggregated in the Eurostat A\*64 list to 58, 59-60, 61, 62-63. In some cases, we are able to obtain additional detail directly from numbers published by the national statistical offices.

|National accounts aggregation levels|     |      |      |      |      |
|:-----------------------------------|:----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|NACE Rev.1.1                        |A3   |A6    |A17   |A31   |A60   |
|NACE Rev.2                          |A\*3 |A\*10 |A\*21 |A\*38 |A\*64 |

## Coverage

The STAN database seems to stop in 2010
:   The ISIC Rev. 3 version of STAN has been maintained until 2010 with data up to 2009 for most countries. Data after 2009 is available from the ISIC Rev. 4 version of STAN.

Are data from 1950-1970 available?
:   STAN only attempts to cover the period from 1970. Even before the 1980s, information for industries other than manufacturing is rather aggregated with few details for service industries.

## Scope

How many enterprises by industry were created during 2013 or 2012 in Mexico?
:   STAN only includes variables from National Accounts. Information on enterprises can be obtained from the OECD Structural and Demographic Business Statistics (SDBS).
