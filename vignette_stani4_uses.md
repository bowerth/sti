# Recommended uses and limitations of STAN

It is recommended that STAN is primarily used for broad analyses, particularly at the detailed level where many of the data points are estimated. For example, looking at trends or average growth rates and shares over a few years, or general modelling. This also applies to any indicators that may be calculated (see Annex. 2 for examples). Where the data points are official National Accounts (often at more aggregate industry levels) there is scope for more precise analyses such as looking at year-on-year growth rates.

STAN is based on data that Member countries provide. Detailed data collections independent of national statistical offices are not performed. In other words, we do not have the scope to build up National Accounts compatible tables from detailed data using consistent methodologies across countries.

Therefore, when comparing variables or indicators across countries, users should refer to the __STAN Country Notes__ (see part 3) to check for industry inclusions and variable definitions. Some compromises may be necessary in terms of the level of detail analysed.
