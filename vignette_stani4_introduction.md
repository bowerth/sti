# Introduction

The __"STAN database for Industrial Analysis"__ provides analysts and researchers with a comprehensive tool for analysing industrial performance at a relatively detailed level of activity. It includes annual measures of output, labour input, investment and international trade that allow users to construct a wide range of indicators to focus on areas such as productivity growth, competitiveness and general structural change. Through the use of a standard industry list, comparisons can be made across countries. The industry list provides sufficient detail to enable users to highlight high-technology sectors and is compatible with those used in related OECD databases.

STAN is primarily based on member countries' Annual National Accounts by activity tables and uses data from other sources, such as national industrial surveys/censuses, to estimate any missing detail. Since many of the data points are estimated, they do not represent official member country submissions.

The current version of STAN is based on the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities, Revision 4 (ISIC Rev.4) and covers all activities (including services). Earlier versions of STAN were based on ISIC Rev.3 and ISIC Rev.2 where the latter covered the manufacturing sector only.

To optimize timeliness, STAN is updated on a 'rolling basis' - new tables are made available as soon as they are ready via OECD.Stat or via OLISnet, the dedicated online service for governments and related agencies. In OECD.Stat, STAN is grouped under "Industry and Services" together with related data sets such as R&D expenditure ([ANBERD](http://www.oecd.org/sti/anberd)) and Bilateral Trade by Industry and End-Use ([BTDIxE](http://www.oecd.org/sti/btd)), derived [STAN Indicators](http://www.oecd.org/sti/stan/indicators). Further examples of indicators derived from STAN variables are available in the latest [Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/oecd-science-technology-and-industry-scoreboard_20725345) publication.

STAN is maintained by the Economic Analysis and Statistics Division of OECD's Directorate for Science, Technology and Industry under the auspices of the Statistical Working Party on Industry Analysis. The data are published on the responsibility of the Secretary-General of the OECD.

## Conventions {#convention}

An important feature of STAN is the use of a standard industry list for all countries to facilitate international comparisons, see table below. The list is based on ISIC Rev.4 (see the [U.N.'s classification registry](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=27)) and includes detailed service sectors. The list is compatible with the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community, Rev.2 (2008) (see [NACE Rev.2 in Eurostat RAMON](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=LST_NOM_DTL\&StrNom=NACE_REV2\&StrLanguageCode=EN\&IntPcKey=\&StrLayoutCode=HIERARCHIC)).

The industry list is designed to provide users with enough detail to focus on technology- and/or knowledge-intensive activities while taking into consideration general data availability across countries (based on recent experience). Also taken into account is:

  - the list used in the previous ISIC Rev.3 version of STAN that accounts for manufactures in the old ISIC Rev.2 version of STAN
  - compatibility with related OECD data sets such as ANBERD and OECD's Input-Output tables INSERT LINK and
  - the level of detail requested in the joint OECD/Eurostat official National Accounts questionnaire.

An additional table showing the industry list together with an approximate ISIC Rev.3 equivalence can be found at INSERT LINK

ISIC codes are abbreviated with `D` for ISIC Rev. 4. Ranges are indicated with `T` between the first and last activity in range. `X` indicates the exclusion of one or more sectors in the range. `A` indicates an aggregate of two non-neighbouring codes.
